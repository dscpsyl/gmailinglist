Dear Jefferson Philadelphia University Thomas Jefferson University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Johnson C Smith University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Judson University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Kentucky Wesleyan College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Kutztown University Of Pennsylvania,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Lake Erie College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Lawrence Technological University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends.

Dear Lemoyne Owen College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Life Pacific College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Long Island University Post Campus,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Loyola Marymount University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Luther Rice College Seminary,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Maharishi University Of Management,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Mansfield University Of Pennsylvania,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Marquette University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Marygrove College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Marywood University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Mercy College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Metropolitan State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Middle Georgia State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Minnesota State University Moorhead,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear Missouri Southern State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Monmouth College Il,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Mount Holyoke College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear Mount Vernon Nazarene University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Nazarene Bible College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear New College Florida,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear New Mexico Institute Of Mining And Technology,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends.

Dear Newberry College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear North Carolina Central University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear North Park University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:
