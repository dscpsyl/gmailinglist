Dear Northwest Missouri State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Northwestern University Qatar,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Nyack College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Ohio Dominican University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

Dear Oklahoma City University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Oral Roberts University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Our Lady Of The Lake University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Pennsylvania Academy Fine Arts,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Pennsylvania State University Dubois Campus,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Pennsylvania State University Schuylkill,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Philander Smith College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Point Park University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

Dear Potomac University Of The,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Purdue University Fort Wayne,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Ramapo College New Jersey,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Richmond American International University London,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Robert Gordon University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Rocky Mountain College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Sage Colleges,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

Dear Saint Leo University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Saint Michaels College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Sam Houston State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Seattle Pacific University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Shenandoah University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Simmons University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Sonoma State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Southern Nazarene University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Southern Wesleyan University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Southwestern Oklahoma State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear St Johns College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear St Lawrence University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear St Petersburg College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Sterling College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Suny College Old Westbury,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Suny Korea,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Suny Purchase College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Tabor College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Texas Lutheran University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear The American College Of Greece,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear The New School College Of Performing Arts,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear The University Of New Mexico,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Trine University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Trinity Washington University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Tuskegee University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear United States Coast Guard Academy,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Universidad Del Sagrado Corazon,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear University Of Bridgeport,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of California Santa Cruz,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Cincinnati Blue Ash College And Clermont College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Findlay,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear University Of Hawaii At Manoa,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Huddersfield,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Jamestown,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear University Of Maine Presque Isle,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear University Of Massachusetts Boston,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong University Of Joint Institute,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Missouri Kansas City,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of North Carolina At Pembroke,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear University Of North Georgia,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Pacific,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Portland,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim
