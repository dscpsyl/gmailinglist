Dear University Of Providence,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Richmond,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Science And Arts Of Oklahoma,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of South Carolina Columbia,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Tennessee Knoxville,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear University Of The Incarnate Word,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of Vermont,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear University Of West Florida,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear University Worcester Uk,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

Dear Valdosta State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Vermont Technical College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Virginia Wesleyan University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Washington And Lee University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Wayne State College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Wellesley College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Western Illinois University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

Dear Western State Colorado University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Wheaton College Il,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Wilberforce University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Winona State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Worcester State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear York College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim
