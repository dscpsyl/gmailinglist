Dear Capital University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Carroll College Montana,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Central Connecticut State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends.

Dear Chaminade University Honolulu,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Cheyney University Of Pennsylvania,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Claflin University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Cogswell Polytechnical College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,

Dear College Of Mount St Vincent,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear College of the Atlantic Atlantic,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Colorado College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Concordia University Irvine,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Conservatory Of Music Of Puerto Rico,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Covenant College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Arcadia, CA, 91007

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Davidson College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Denison University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Dillard University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear Earlham College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Eastern Connecticut State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Eastern University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim
