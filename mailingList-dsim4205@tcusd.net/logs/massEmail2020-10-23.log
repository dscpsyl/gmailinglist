Dear Edgewood College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Elms College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Emmanuel College Ga,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Fashion Institute Of Technology,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Fitchburg State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Florida Institute Technology,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Franklin Marshall College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,

Dear Furman University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Georgetown University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Governors State University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear Granite State College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Gustavus Adolphus College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Haverford College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Dear Hillsdale College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Holy Names University,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

Dear Illinois College,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Indiana University East,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear Inter American University Of Puerto Rico Aguadilla,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

Dear IPFW,

Hello, my name is David Sim and I am currently a senior in high school.

As I was creating my list of potential colleges and universities to apply to, your school caught my attention. From your website, your statistics seem to fit most of my criteria and has a lot of what I am looking for in a higher education experience. From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave
UNIT C
Arcadia, CA, 91007
USA

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
David Sim

From your campus size to location, this looks like a school that I would love to be apart of.

A little about me: I am a high school senior with a 3.95 GPA. While I’ve been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic, my plan is to still take them near the end of the year or in the spring before my high school year ends. I have taken most AP classes offered by my school and I am always looking for ways to challenge and improve myself.

I was wondering if you could send me more information and possibly even some swag my way to help show off this amazing school! My shirt size is a medium.;) You can always reach me at this email or my personal email: dss16838@yahoo.com. My address is:

802 W Naomi Ave

Please let me know if you need anything else or would like to get in touch. Thank you for your time and stay safe, stay healthy!

Best wishes and a large McDonald sprite,
